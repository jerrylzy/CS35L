    diff --brief no longer mistakenly reports diff. with 0-sized /proc/ files
    
    Normally, it is safe to assume two regular files are different when
    their st_size values are different.  However, that assumption may
    be invalid if either value is zero, as happens with files on Linux
    /proc and /sys file systems. Since skipping this optimization will
    usually cost very little (one read syscall, to read zero bytes),
    it is fine to accommodate those unusual files.
    * src/analyze.c (diff_2_files): Do not assume regular files differ
    just because their st_size values differ when one or more is 0.
    * src/diff.c (compare_files): Likewise.
    * tests/brief-vs-proc-stat-zero: New test.
    * tests/Makefile.am: Add it.
    * NEWS (Bug fixes): Describe it.

    tests: arrange to print any skipped-test explanation to tty, too
    
    I noticed that when a test was skipped, the reason was not printed.
    This fixes it.  In coreutils, this variable is set in init.cfg,
    but there is no point in putting the definition so far from the
    code that chooses the file descriptor number in tests/Makefile.am.
    * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT) [stderr_fileno_]: Define
    here (to 9), right next to the companion "9>&2".

    The simplest solution is to remove the TOO_EXPENSIVE heuristic

    circa-1993 hardware, these days the heuristic seems to be more
    trouble than it's worth.

Date:   Sat Mar 23 00:21:45 2013 -0700

    maint: update build procedure to recent gettext etc.
    
    * bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add vararrays.
    (needed_gnulib_files, unnecessary_gettext_files): New vars.
    (bootstrap_post_import_hook): New function, to implement these vars.
    (excluded_files): Remove; 'bootstrap' no longer supports this.
    Its function is now performed by unnecessary_gettext_files.
    (buildreq): Update automake to 1.12.2, to avoid CVE-2012-3386.
    * configure.ac (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Bump from 0.17 to 0.18.2,
    to lessen the probability that we'll have outlandishly old files
    during a build.
    * m4/vararrays.m4: Remove from repository, as we now use the
    gnulib version.

    build: update gnulib to latest and adapt; update bootstrap, too
    
    Blindly updating to the latest from gnulib, bootstrap would
    fail due to failure of our local patches to apply.  Hence,
    these first two updates.
    * gl/lib/regex_internal.c.diff: Update offsets, so this patch
    applies to the latest from gnulib.
    * gl/lib/regex_internal.h.diff: Remove file.  No longer needed.
    * bootstrap: Update from gnulib.

    build: default to --enable-gcc-warnings in a git tree
    
    Anyone building from cloned sources can be assumed to have a new
    enough environment, such that enabling gcc warnings by default will
    be useful.  Tarballs still default to no warnings, and the default
    can still be overridden with --disable-gcc-warnings.

    Problem reported by Eli Zaretskii in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2012-05/msg00013.html>.
    Approach suggested by Bruno Haible as option (4) in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2012-05/msg00036.html>.
    * bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add system-quote.
    * src/diff3.c, src/sdiff.c, src/util.c:
    Include <system-quote.h>, not <sh-quote.h>.
    * src/diff3.c (read_diff):
    * src/sdiff.c (main, edit):
    * src/util.c (begin_output):
    Use system_quote_argv, for portability to Mingw.
    * src/sdiff.c (NUM_SIGS, handler_index_of_SIGINT): Now enum
    values, not macros; this is cleaner and avoids a GCC warning if
    !HAVE_WORKING_VFORK.
    * src/util.c (begin_output) [! HAVE_WORKING_FORK]: Do not use -f,
    for consistency with the HAVE_WORKING_FORK code.

    tests: use "compare exp out", not "compare out exp"
    
    Likewise, when an empty file is expected, use "compare /dev/null out",
    not "compare out /dev/null". I.e., specify the expected/desired contents
    via the first file name.  Prompted by a suggestion from Bruno Haible
    in http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.grep.bugs/4020/focus=29154
    
    Run these commands:
    
      git grep -l -E 'compare [^ ]+ exp' \
        |xargs perl -pi -e 's/\b(compare) (\S+) (exp\S*)/$1 $3 $2/'
      git grep -l -E 'compare [^ ]+ /dev/null' \
        |xargs perl -pi -e 's,\b(compare) (\S+) (/dev/null),$1 $3 $2,'
    
    But manually convert this one:
    
      -compare out exp-$(echo $opt|tr ' ' _)
      +compare exp-$(echo $opt|tr ' ' _) out
    
    and avoid an inappropriate change to cfg.mk.

    All the test scripts in the diffutils testsuite are shell scripts,
    so the current definition of TESTS_ENVIRONMENT, which adaptively
    run tests using either perl or the shell depending on their kind,
    is an overkill.
    
    Moreover, this change is required in order for the testsuite to
    continue to work with the new testsuite harness that is planned
    to be introduced in Automake 1.12 (which, as of the writing date,
    is still under development and in late alpha state).
    
    See also related discussion on bug-coreutils:
     <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=8887>
    
    * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove definition of the
    `shell_or_perl_' shell function, which is not required anymore.
    (LOG_COMPILER): New, define to `$(SHELL)'.
    * tests/binary: Make executable.
    * tests/colliding-file-names: Likewise.
    * tests/excess-slash: Likewise.
    * tests/no-newline-at-eof: Likewise.

    portability: use SET_BINARY rather than xfreopen (NULL, ...
    
    * src/diff.c: Include binary-io.h, not xfreopen.h.
    (main): Use SET_BINARY (...) rather than xfreopen (NULL, X, ...),
    because the latter doesn't work on MinGW and crashes using MSVC.
    * src/cmp.c (main): Likewise.

    tests: avoid newer but less-portable tail option syntax
    
    * tests/function-line-vs-leading-space: Use sed -n '3,$p' rather than
    tail -n+3.  Older versions of tail do not accept that newer syntax.

    tests: fix an erroneous test
    
    On most systems, like-named files were compared, by luck.
    However, on others, different-named files would be compared
    since their names were being treated as equal -- but they had
    different content, so the test would fail.
    * tests/colliding-file-names: Use different sets of file names
    in d1 and d2 so that they cannot accidentally match.
    Put the same line in each test file.  This is required
    when files named e.g., abc and ABC are compared.
    This test was failing on a NixOS 86_64-darwin system.

commit f444711a2639b4974ff3e720c455a1f96f1109e8
Author: Jim Meyering <meyering@redhat.com>

    diff: fix a regression when at least one input lacks a newline-at-EOF,
    
    and the final hunk plus context-length aligns exactly with the end
    of the newline-lacking file.  Diff would fail to output the required
    "\ No newline at end of file" line, thus rendering the output invalid.
    This bug appears to have been introduced by 2006-05-07
    commit 58d0483b, "(find_identical_ends): Fix huge performance bug...",
    at least to the extent that reverting that change fixes the bug.
    Considering the stated effect of that change and lack of metrics,
    reverting it is not an option, so here we take a more direct approach.
    
    Given these inputs,
    
        printf '\n1'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b
    
    and running diff like this:
    
        ./diff -U1 a b
    
    for input file "b", the pointer, files[1].linbuf[4][-1], to
    the last byte on the final line was mistakenly pointing at the
    sentinel newline at EOF, rather than at the preceding byte.
    
      (gdb) p files[1].linbuf[4][-1]
      $3 = 10 '\n'
    
    Thus, this test in the final print_1_line call:
    
      if ((!line_flag || line_flag[0]) && limit[-1] != '\n')
        fprintf (out, "\n\\ %s\n", _("No newline at end of file"));
    
    would fail, because limit[-1] (which is files[1].linbuf[4][-1])
    was mistakenly '\n', rather than the desired '1'.
    
    My first thought was simply to adjust the final linbuf[line] setting,
    at the end of io.c's find_and_hash_each_line function function:
    
           if (p == bufend)
    -       break;
    +       {
    +         if (current->missing_newline)
    +           --linbuf[line];
    +         break;
    +       }
    
    But that would make diff misbehave with this input
    (same as above, but with a newline appended to "a"),
    
        printf '\n1\n'>a; printf '\n0\n\n1'>b
        ./diff -U1 a b
    
    due to the block (100 lines above) that is triggered in that case
    (but not in the both-files-missing-newline case):
    
          if (p == bufend
              && current->missing_newline
              && ROBUST_OUTPUT_STYLE (output_style))
            {
              /* This line is incomplete.  If this is significant,
                 put the line into buckets[-1].  */
              if (ignore_white_space < IGNORE_SPACE_CHANGE)
                bucket = &buckets[-1];
    
              /* Omit the inserted newline when computing linbuf later.  */
              p--;
              bufend = suffix_begin = p;
            }
    
    Note how "p" is decremented and "bufend" adjusted.
    When that happens, we certainly don't want to decrement
    "bufend" yet again.
    
    Since there is no other way to determine at the end whether "bufend"
    was already decremented, add a new variable to serve as witness.

    with -F or -p, emit better function lines: no leading white space
    
    * src/diff.c (print_context_function): For languages like Ada
    that allow local functions and procedures, the plain context
    function line may start with enough blank characters that the
    function name does not get completely printed in the 40
    characters limit.  This patch solves this problem by removing
    these useless initial blank characters.

Author: Jim Meyering <meyering@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 18 12:59:29 2010 +0100

    revert 2002 change that removed "Binary " from "files A and B differ"
    
    With this change, "printf '\0'|diff - /dev/null" now prints
    "Binary files - and /dev/null differ" once again.
    This reverts 2002-06-28 commit a352f0980,
    "(briefly_report): Don't say "Binary files differ", ...".
    * src/analyze.c (briefly_report): Do include the "Binary " prefix
    in the diagnostic, when !brief.
    * NEWS (Changes in behavior): Mention the diagnostic change.

    maint: change use of "|" to more maintainable "||" (no semantic change)
    
    * src/analyze.c (diff_2_files): Using the "||" operator happens to
    be equivalent to using "|" in this case.  It is also clearer and
    less prone to inadvertent bug introduction, in case the variable,
    "changes" were ever to take on a value not in {0,1}.

    * lib/Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS): Append $(WARN_CFLAGS) and

    This was introduced via 2009-12-17 commit e58efa5b
    "build: enable warnings and -Werror.",
    but fortunately is not a bug, because the definition
    it would have overridden was always empty.

    dereferenced.  However, that cannot happen, because for all callers,
    the parameter, parent, is always non-NULL at that point.
    * src/diff.c: Include <assert.h>.
    Assert that parent is not NULL.

    * doc/diff.texi (White Space): Note that newline always ends a line,
    so -w doesn't ignore newline-related changes.  Problem reported by

    Modernize bootstrap procedure to match current gnulib.
    * bootstrap: Sync with coreutils bootstrap, except check that
    the directory build-aux exists before trying to copy to it.
    * bootstrap.conf: New file.
    (gnulib_modules): Add config-h, dup2, extensions, fcntl, fdl,
    stat-macros, unistd.
    * configure.ac: Invoke gl_EARLY and gl_INIT rather than
    GNULIB_AUTOCONF_SNIPPET.
    (AC_CONFIG_HEADER): Rename config.h to lib/config.h.
    (AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE): Don't check for fcntl.h, locale.h,
    sys/file.h, unistd.h.  We now use the fcntl and unistd modules,
    and locale.h can be assumed for any C89 compiler.
    (DIFFUTILS_PREREQUISITES): Remove.  No longer needed now that
    we use the stdint module.
    (AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE): Remove dup2, which is no longer needed
    now that we use the dup2 module.
    (AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Use need-formatstring-macros, and ...
    (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): specify version 0.15 instead of 0.14.5,
    to be consistent with coreutils.
    * lib/Makefile.am (noinst_LIBRARIES):
    (lib_SOURCES, libdiffutils_a_LIBADD):
    (libdiffutils_a_DEPENDENCIES, BUILT_SOURCES, EXTRA_DIST):
    (MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Remove; now computed automatically.
    (noinst_HEADERS, libdiffutils_a_SOURCES): Just append
    our special files now.
    * lib/cmpbuf.c: Include config.h unconditionally, since we
    no longer define HAVE_CONFIG_H.
    * lib/prepargs.c: Likewise.
    * src/Makefile.am (LDADD): Use $(LIBINTL), not @LIBINTL@.
    (diff_LDADD): Use $(LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME), not @LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME@.
    * src/dir.c (dir_read): Use _D_EXACT_NAMLEN, not NAMELEN.

    Include stat-macros.h.
    (S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR):

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Tue May 9 22:57:20 2006 +0000

    * src/cmp.c (cmp): The previous fix wasn't quite right either, as
    it mishandled 'cmp A B >/dev/null' when A is shorter than B and
    differs before A's end-of-file, by outputting a bogus EOF message.
    Also, it was inefficient if A and B were large.

    * src/cmp.c (cmp): Fix bug introduced in 2006-03-09 change.
    For example, "cmp <(echo b) <(echo a) > /dev/null" incorrectly
    succeeded.  Problem reported by Jim Meyering.

Date:   Sun May 7 08:16:19 2006 +0000

    * src/context.c (pr_context_hunk, pr_unidiff_hunk):
    Prefer fputs or fputc to fprintf, since it's a tad more efficient
    with unlocked-IO on glibc.  Long ago we avoided fputs to
    work around an ancient SunOS bug, but that's no longer relevant.
    * src/diff3.c (output_diff3, dotlines, undotlines):
    (output_diff3_edscript, output_diff3_merge): Likewise.
    This also avoids a gcc -Wformat-security warning reported
    by Jim Meyering.
    * src/ed.c (print_ed_hunk, print_forward_ed_hunk, print_rcs_hunk):
    Likewise.
    * src/normal.c (print_normal_hunk): Likewise.

    find_identical_ends and doc/diff.texi fixes

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Sun May 7 04:07:41 2006 +0000

    (find_identical_ends): Fix huge performance bug that I
    introduced in the 2001-11-25 change: the code to remove the
    identical suffix also looked at the trailing sentinel, which meant
    the common suffix length was always incorrectly calculated to be
    zero.  Problem and fix reported by Daniel Hipschman.  Instead of
    his fix, revert to the (nearly-equivalent) pre-2001 code.

    Adjust to stat-time.h macros when accessing nanoseconds.

    excluded_file_name.

    internals.
    New local OPT to hold former statics; initialize it.
    (init_regexp_list): New function, used by main.
    (summarize_regexp_list): Now returns struct re_pattern_buffer *, and

    (paths.h): Send output to paths.ht first, and then rename to

    New member `eof'.
    
    (FILE_BUFFER): New macro.

    (PACKAGE, VERSION, diffutils_srcs, D): New vars.
    (version.c, version.texi, messages.po): New files.
    messages.po is built automatically from source files and `getmsgids'.
    Each function and macro whose first parameter is a gettext msgid
    has had its first parameter's name changed so it ends in `msgid'.
    All arrays of msgids have had their names changed to end in `msgid'.
    `getmsgids' uses this to determine which strings are msgids.
    All strings that are messages are passed through gettext once before
    being used, so that they can be localized.
    Several diagnostics have been changed slightly, to make them more consistent
    and easier to translate.
    (distfiles): Add them, pc/*, and getmsgids.
    (diff.info): Now depends on version.texi.
    (realclean): Clean messages.po, version.*.
    (dist): Just build $D.tar.gz.
    ($D.tar.gz): New file, takes over old `dist' function.
    Don't assume $(distfiles) are all in same directory.

    (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add test for memchr.
    (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for memchr, not memcpy, since it'll be cached.

    (memcmp): Define in terms of bcmp.
    Use HAVE_MEMCHR to test for all mem* routines.

commit 9bb6665825b1d7f807400fd4fe08f6997fe06fdc
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Tue Sep 13 18:46:43 1994 +0000

    (srcs): Remove memcmp.c.  We use bcmp if memcmp doesn't work, since
    we only test for equality.

commit 2f93e7ee108f1f13c923edb19fa57ef45df61b67
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 12 15:52:22 1994 +0000

    (line_cmp): Now takes just two arguments, and no longer optimizes
    for common case of exact equality; the caller does that optimization now.
    Optimize for the common case of mostly exact equality.
    Use isupper/tolower instead of islower/toupper, for consistency.
    (line_cmp, print_line): Use '\n' instead of line_end_char.

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 12 15:52:22 1994 +0000

    (binary_file_p): Assume non-broken memchr.
    (find_and_hash_each_line): Revamp to fix some inconsistencies with -b -w -i
    and incomplete lines.  Incomplete lines are now put into their own bucket.
    This means line_cmp no longer needs line length arguments,
    and equivalence classes' line length no longer need to include \n.
    Invoke line_cmp only if memcmp fails and if ignore_some_line_changes.
    (prepare_text_end): -B no lonter ignores missing newlines.
    (read_files): Allocate another bucket for incomplete lines.

    (PARAMS, VOID): Define earlier so that malloc decl can use VOID.
    (STAT_BLOCKSIZE): Simplify ersatz defn; just use 8K.
    (dirent): Renamed from direct; dirent makes the code more standard.
    <limits.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>: Include only if corresponding HAVE_*_H.

Date:   Mon Sep 13 14:22:57 1993 +0000

    (struct group): New struct.
    (print_ifdef_lines): Use it to simplify argument passing.  Remove the
    convention that last arg -1 signifies that the lines from file 2 are
    the same as the lines from file 1; this convention no longer works,
    now that line numbers might be printed out, since the line's numbers
    may differ.  Add first FILE * argument to output to.  All callers changed.
    Use a faster test for the single-fwrite optimization.
    Add support for %?c, %(A=B?T:E), PRINTF_SPECn formats.
    (format_group, scan_printf_spec, groups_letter_value): New functions.
    (format_ifdef): 1st arg is no longer const pointer.

    Use size_t, not int, when needed.  Use STD{IN,OUT,ERR}_FILENO instead of [012].
    (struct msg, msg_chain, msg_chain_end): Moved here from diff.h.
    (message5): New function.
    (pr_pid): New var.
    (begin_output): Allocate `name' more precisely.
    Put child pid into pr_pid, so that we can wait for it later.
    Don't check execl's return value, since any return must be an error.
    (finish_output): Detect and report output errors.
    Use waitpid if available.  Check pr exit status.
    (line_cmp): Use locale's definition of white space
    instead of using one hardwired defn for -b and another for -w.
    (analyze_cmp): Avoid double negation with `! nontrivial'.
    Pacify `gcc -Wall' be rewriting for-loop into do-while-loop.
    (dir_file_pathname): New function.

    (version_string): Now char[], not char*.
    (private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file names.

    exit with that signal's status.
    (lf_refill, main, skip_white, edit, interact): Check for signal.
    (ignore_SIGINT): Renamed from `ignore_signals'.
    (NUM_SIGS, initial_handler): New macros.
    (initial_action, signal_received, sigs_trapped): New vars.
    (catchsig, trapsigs): Use sigaction if possible, since this closes the
    windows of vulnerability that `signal' has.  Use RETSIGTYPE not void.
    When a signal comes in, just set a global variable; this is safer.
    (checksigs, untrapsig): New functions.
    (edit): Pacify `gcc -Wall' with a useless assignment.
    Respond to each empty line with help, not to every other empty line.
    (private_tempnam): Remove hardcoded limit on temporary file name length.
    Don't assume sizeof (pid_t) <= sizeof (int).

    Add prototypes to function declarations.  Use size_t, not int, when needed.
    Use `const' when needed to pacify gcc.
    Use STD{IN,OUT,ERR}_FILENO instead of [012].
    (usage): Sort options.
    (filetype): New function.
    (compare_files): Set stdin's st_mtime to be the current time.
    Leave its name "-" instead of changing it to "Standard Input";
    to test whether a file is stdin, we must compare its name to "-" instead
    of its desc to 0, since if it's closed other file descs may be 0.
    When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
    looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
    account before deciding whether the files are identical.
    Pretend that nonexistent files have the same filetype as existing files.
    Rename `errorcount' to `failed', since it's boolean.
    In directory comparisons, if a file is neither a regular file nor a
    directory, just print its type and the other file's type.

    Add prototypes to function declarations.  Use size_t, not int, when needed.
    Use `const' when needed to pacify gcc.  Use 0, not NULL, for portability.
    Make globals static when possible.
    
    (file): Now a 2-element array; replaces `file1' and `file2'.
    (file_desc, buffer): Likewise, for file[12]_desc and buf[12].
    (main): Likewise, for stat_buf[12].  Index these variables with `i'.
    
    (ignore_initial): New var.
    (long_options): Now const.  Add `--ignore-initial'.
    (usage): Sort options and add `--ignore-initial'.
    (main, cmp): Add `--ignore-initial' support.
    
    (main): `cmp - -' now succeeds.  Use STD{IN,OUT,ERR}_FILENO instead of [012].
    When comparing standard input to a file, and using a shortcut (e.g.
    looking at file sizes or inode numbers), take the lseek offset into
    account before deciding whether the files are identical.
    Avoid mentioning `dev_t', `ino_t' for portability to nonstandard hosts.
    Use l.c.m. of files' buffer sizes, not 8 * 1024.
    ferror (stdout) does not imply errno has a useful value.
    If 2nd file is "-", treat it first, in case stdin is closed.
    
    (cmp): Always compute `char_number', `smaller' for speed and simplicity.
    Say `cmp: EOF on input', not `/usr/gnu/bin/cmp: EOF on input',
    as per Posix.2.
    
    (block_compare_and_count): Increment line_number argument.
    Remove end_char argument; it's always '\n'.  All callers changed.
    Do not assume sizeof(long) == 4; this isn't true on some 64-bit hosts.
    (block_compare): Minimize differences with block_compare_and_count.
