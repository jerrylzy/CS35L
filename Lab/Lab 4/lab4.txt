1. Get a copy of the Diffutils repository

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. Get a log of changes
git log > git-log.txt

3. Generate a list of tags
git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Find the commit and generate a patch
Find out the hash:
emacs git-log.txt
Then I used C-s to search for the key word "maint: quote 'like this'..."

git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f \
--stdout > quote-patch.txt

Then I used this to generate the patch and put it into quote_patch.txt

5. Check out version 3.0
git checkout -b 'my3.0' 'v3.0'

I checked out version 3.0 and made a new branch called my3.0

6. Patch
patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

Problems encountered:

a. No such file exists:
HACKING
doc/diffutils.texi
man/help2man

b. Conflicts:
README: at 9, 60
README-hacking: at 19
cfg.mk: at 29
src/diff.c: at 876, 906, 942
src/diff3.c: at 433

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

8. Learn to use Emacs functions
I learned that I can use vc-revert to revert changes.

9. Reverting changes
I used emacs to open NEWS, README, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat,
ms/config.site, po/en.po, src/diff.h, src/system.h, tests/help-version

I used vc-revert (C-x v u) to discard changes to those files.


For .c files, I discarded changes to comments.
I used vc-diff (C-x v =) function to check changes.

I used M-g g to go to the line numbers specified in vc-diff.
I used M-% to replace the first ' with `


line number specified in vc-diff for discarded changes:
analyze.c: all
cmp.c: 36, 364, 377
context.c: all changes, I used vc-revert.
diff.c: 40, 57 (3 lines there), 92
diff3.c: 35, 159, 1475
dir.c: 87, 125, 234
ifdef.c: all
io.c: all
sdiff.c: 35, 92, 747
side.c: all
util.c: 27, 121, 146, 190, 241, 270, 650

10. Manually Apply Changes of rejected patches

Reason: The merge failed because line numbers and strings didn't match.
diff.c: I manually searched those sentences and manually changed ` to '
diff3.c: same as above

11. Remove untracked files
I used
find . -type f -name '*.orig' -delete
and
find . -type f -name '*.rej' -delete

to delete unwanted files

12. Patch for v3.0
git status gives us:

#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c

It's half a dozen of files

Patch:
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. Build the resulting modified version
I first run:
./bootstrap

I patched the additional patch since I'm using lnxsrv09.

/*
 * Detail:
 * I first changed the path in the first line
 * from old to lib and saved it to gets.diff.
 * Then I used patch -p0 < gets.diff
 *
 */

Then:
./configure
make

Then:
./src/diff . -
and
./src/diff --help

Both give the right quote mark.

14. Sanity Test
cd ..
mkdir diffutils-3.0
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-3.0-orig
Cloned code into folder diffutils-3.0-orig

cd diffutils-3.0-orig

git checkout 'v3.0' -b 'o3.0'
Checkout the original v3.0 code.

cp ./src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0/
Copy the original source codes to diffutils-3.0

cd ..

cp ./diffutils/src/*.c ./diffutils-3.0-patch/
Copy the patched source codes to diffutils-3.0-patch

./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
I used the patched diff to compare

Compare two patches:
diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt

There seem to be a lot of differences, but the don't differ in actual contents.
The differences are mainly from paths for files and hashes.

In quote-3.0-test.txt, the diff part for diff3.c is ahead of diff.c,
while in quote-3.0-patch.txt, it comes after diff.c.

When I clip them to be in the same position (I created a new file for this)
Every difference is innocuous.
