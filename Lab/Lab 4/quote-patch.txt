Subject: [PATCH] maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
`like this' or ``like this''.

Quote 'like this' or "like this" in commentary.
* cfg.mk (old_NEWS_hash): Adjust to reflect new NEWS quoting.
* man/help2man: Update to 1.40.4 version, with quoting fixed as above.
* po/en.po: Remove translation involving `, as it's no longer needed.
