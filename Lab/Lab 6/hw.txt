The resulting network is still secure for the public-key cryptosystem,
because the private key is stored on the computer and other teams have no way
to find out what our private key is. So they cannot enter our host and decrypt
any kind of message between our team.
Also, it is computationally infeasible to find out the private key
given the public key. So our network is still secure.

(1) Still secure
If other teams had also tapped our keyboards and
had observed all of our keystrokes, they still cannot find out what
our private key is since even if we use the same passphrase, the generated
private key is going to be different.

(2) Depends
If the system files are located on the USB drive, then they can directly
read the private key data and use the private key they obtained to decipher
all of our communications and log into our host.
Otherwise, they cannot do any damage since they still do not know our
private key.

The program verifies whether the the target file and the detached
signatures match or not. It is useful when people can verify my public keys.
However, since a hacker can replace the public key inside, recreate the tarball,
and then output the detached signature file from the tar file,
(possibly using my name and emails),
the gpg --verify command doesn't really help here since it only verifies whether
the signatures are good and match.

To fix this, I can post my public key / my detached signature file
on the web and anyone who downloaded my tar file can verify whether
the file is created by me and whether the file is modified.
We can rely on CA's to send our public keys securely
so that the receiver can be assured to have the right key to verify.
